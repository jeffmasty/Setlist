GmI've been walking in the rain just to geCt wet on purpose
I've been forcing myself not to forget just to feel worse
I've been getting away with it all my life (getting away)


Chorus
HoweveD#r I look it's Fclear to see ThatGm I love you more than Cyou love me
HoweveD#r I look it's Fclear to see That GmI love you more than you love me


GmI hate that mirror, it makes me feel Cso worthless
I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you couldn't care less
I've been getting away with it all my life
Getting away with it all my life


(Back to Chorus then into solo using same chords)

GmI thought I gave up falling in loCve a long long time ago
I guess I like it but I can't tell you, you shouldn't really know
And it's been true all my life
Yes, it's been true all my life
